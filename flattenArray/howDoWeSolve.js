1. Understand the problem.
    a. Restate the problem in your own words.

    b. What are the inputs that go in the problem?

    c. What are the outputs that should come from the problem?

    d. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?

    e. How should i label important pieces of data?

2. Explore concrete examples.

    ([1, [2], [3, [[4]]]])) returns [1,2,3,4]
3. Break it down.
